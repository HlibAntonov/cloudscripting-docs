# Placeholders
Cloud Scripting supports a list of placeholders that can be used in any section of manifest file (if the section isn't strictly limited with its content).
The executor will try to resolve all placeholders on the package installation stage.
If it's not possible placeholder will be unresolved and displayed in the text as is (e.g. ${placeholder})

## Environment placeholders
