# Writing Scripts

Custom users’ scripts can be written in Java, PHP or JavaScript. Inside these scripts, the set of client libraries for platform’s API methods calling is available. 
A script can be subscribed to the onAfterReturn event on its outlet for, for example, execution of the [Call](/reference/actions/#call) action.
