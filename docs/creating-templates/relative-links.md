#Relative Links

The relative links functionality is intended to specify the JPS fileâ€™s base URL, in relation to which the subsequent links can be set throughout the manifest. This source destination (URL) can point either to the text of the file or its raw code. Therefore, it is passed in the manifest through the *baseUrl* parameter or specified while <a href="https://docs.jelastic.com/environment-export-import" target="_blank">Importing</a> a corresponding JPS file via the Jelastic dashboard.          

`baseUrl` inside manifest has higher priority than installation by URL.

Simple example:
```
{
    "jpsType" : "update",
    "name" : "Base URL test",
    "baseUrl" : "https://github.com/jelastic-jps/minio/blob/master",
    "onInstall" : {
        "log" : "Base URL test"
    },
    "onAfterRestartNode[nodeGroup:cp]" : {
        "script" : "build-cluster.js"
    },
    "success" : "README.md"
}
```

In case manifest is installing by URL via Import Jelastic feature than `baseUrl` placeholder will defined if URL like example bellow:
  
```
{protocol}://{domain}/myfile.extension
```
In the end of URL should be file name with extension. 

Cloud Scriptiong rules for parsing relative path for file:

  - `baseUrl` parameter is defined;
  - text doesn't contain whitespaces (includes tabs, line breaks);
  - text doesn't contain semicolons and round brackets.

If installation is going from <a href="https://github.com/jelastic-jps" target="_blank">*GitHub*</a> and URL is consists */blob/* - it will replaced to */raw/* word.
if `baseUrl` parameter is defined without slash in the end, it will be added automatically.
 
Cloud Scripting engine supports placeholder `${baseUrl}`. Every customer can use it in their customs scripts (in [`cmd`](actions/#cmd), [`script`](actions/#script) actions).

For example:

```
{
  "jpsType" : "update",
  "name" : "Test Base URL",
  "baseUrl" : "http://example.com/",
  "onInstall" : {
    "cmd [cp]" : {
      "curl -fSs '${baseUrl}script.sh'"
    }
  }
}
```

##Success Text Customize

Ability to customize `success` text inside manifest. See examples bellow:

- set [`baseUrl`](creating-templates/relative-links/) relative URL which is based path for README.md file in success text:
```
{
    "jpsType" : "update",
    "name" : "Success Text first example",
    "baseUrl" : "https://github.com/jelastic-jps/minio",
    "onInstall" : {
        "log" : "success text first example"
    },
    "success" : "README.md"
}
```

- customizing `success` text by external link:
```
{
  "jpsType": "update",
  "name": "Success Text Second Example",
  "onInstall": {
    "log": "success Text Second Example"
  },
  "success": "https://github.com/jelastic-jps/lets-encrypt/raw/master/README.md"
}
```

`Success` text can be divided on two values:

 - text on dashboard when application will be installed
 
```
{
  "jpsType": "update",
  "name": "Success Text Second Example",
  "onInstall": {
    "log": "success Text Second Example"
  },
  "success": {
    "text": "https://github.com/jelastic-jps/lets-encrypt/raw/master/README.md"
  }
}
```
 
 - text to notify user about successfull application installation by email
 
```
{
  "jpsType": "update",
  "name": "Success Text Test 4",
  "baseUrl": "https://git.jelastic.com/sk/jps-test/raw/master/",
  "onInstall": {
    "log": "success text test 4"
  },
  "success": {
    "email": "README.md",
    "en": "README.md",
    "ru": "https://github.com/jelastic-jps/git-push-deploy/blob/master/README.md"
  }
}
```

Last example also shows localization functionality depends on Jelastic platform selected language.
